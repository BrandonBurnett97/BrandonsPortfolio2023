			<h2><span>My</span> Thesis</h2>
			
<p>A concept that was created in my time at College. For our thesis we were to come up with a problem related to us in some way and find a solution for that problem. For me, I chose a therapeutic massage chair connected to an app. This stems from the back pain I’ve had in the past and not seeking proper therapy. </p>

	<p>My thesis is based on people who abuse their backs and ignore the consequences. Therapeutic massage chairs are on the market. However, this isn’t any ordinary massage chair in your living room. This is a 3 piece full body massage chair that can be folded to take with you. This is targeted for those with benefit plans and professional athletes to rent out the product. The 3 sections of the massage chair are the neck massager to better hit your neck muscles. Leg massager unit, and the chair itself. Arm and foot massager’s are also added to this product as an extra.</p>

	<p>The app is divided by 5 sections. The top right would a be series of exercises to strengthen your muscles.
     Top left would be where your resources and links will be saved. 
     Bottom right is for health assistance. This section will help you determine a problem by simply tapping the muscle chart that is sore and asking a few basic questions. After the questions are answered, the app will send you a link that will be saved in your resources. Bottom right is where your customized massage patterns will be saved.
	the final section, big red circle, is where you will begin the massage!</p> 

	<p> The 3D model was created in fusion 360. The model was created to present how the massage chair would look. In this image is the chair component folded. The handle in the back is used for you to carry it as a suitcase. Due to the 200 pounds of technology. This would be the easiest way for transportation.</p>
